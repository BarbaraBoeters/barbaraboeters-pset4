Pset 4 - TODO List App

Use of SQLite creating a table with multiple columns which you can update and delete. The app works like follows: you add a task and it pops up immediately. Next you can do is change th switch to 'on' so you know you have done it. You can swipe on the item to the left to delete it.

Layout: still working on to make it more appealing. For now it works and the constrains are fine. 

Troubles: experienced some difficulties figuring out how the sqlite worked. I found a tutorial on the internet and because of this I learned how to access and use the SQL. Source: https://www.sitepoint.com/managing-data-in-ios-apps-with-sqlite/

Also I used this website to apply the delete function: http://www.ioscreator.com/tutorials/delete-rows-table-view-ios8-swift
